To create a `README.md` for your FastAPI projects, I'll structure the document to cover both the Bank Iris Dataset and Furniture Dataset applications. The README will include sections like an introduction, how to install and run the projects, and a brief description of each app including the provided screenshots. 

Here's a draft for your README.md:

# FastAPI Projects: Bank Iris and Furniture Datasets

## Introduction
This repository contains two FastAPI applications: one for the Bank Iris dataset and another for the Furniture dataset. These applications are designed to demonstrate the use of FastAPI for creating APIs in Python with machine learning integration.

## Installation
To run these projects, you need to have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository and navigate to each project's directory to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Applications
Navigate to the project directory and run the application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Replace `app:app` with the appropriate module name for each application.

Since we included the uvicorn inside the apps, you can run them just using python (the name of the file).


## Bank Iris Dataset Application
The Bank Iris application is a FastAPI implementation for predicting iris species based on input features. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model.

### Features
- Predict species based on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- Fast and efficient predictions with FastAPI.

## Furniture Dataset Application
The Furniture application provides an API for predicting furniture categories based on various attributes.

### Features
- Predict furniture categories like chair, table, etc.
- Utilizes a machine learning model trained on the Furniture dataset.

## Conclusion
These applications are examples of how FastAPI can be used to build efficient and scalable APIs for machine learning applications. Feel free to explore and modify the code.
