# SageMaker Lab: ML with Amazon SageMaker

**Professor:** Fahd KALLOUBI  
**Year:** 2023/2024  
**Major:** QFM â€“ Data Engineering

## Overview

In this lab, we will explore Amazon SageMaker, a powerful cloud-native tool for training and deploying machine learning models into production. The lab focuses on two main aspects: Data Processing and Model Training.

### Official SageMaker SDK Documentation
- [SageMaker SDK Documentation](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io)

## 1. Data Processing using SageMaker

### Problem Description
- **Objective:** Improve strategies for the next marketing campaign for a financial institution (a bank).
- **Task:** Analyze the latest marketing campaign carried out by the bank to identify patterns and develop future strategies.

### Data Source
- Moro et al. 2014: A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. [Link to Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016792361400061X)

### Lab Instructions
1. Run `Bank-Marketing.ipynb` in your local environment.
2. Access your Amazon Academy space and start Lab 3.1 - Amazon SageMaker - Creating and importing data.
3. Follow instructions to create and configure a SageMaker Notebook instance.

#### Key Steps
- Data downloading and extraction.
- Data loading using Pandas.
- Uploading dataset to Amazon S3.
- Running the processing script `preprocessing.py`.

## 2. Training a Model using SageMaker SDK with Built-in Algorithms

### Task
- Train a regression model on the Boston Housing dataset.

#### Data Preparation
- Load the dataset `housing.csv`.
- Format the dataset as per Amazon SageMaker requirements.

#### Training Instructions
1. Upload the prepared dataset to S3.
2. Configure the training job using the Estimator object.
3. Set the hyperparameters and define data channels.
4. Run the training job.
